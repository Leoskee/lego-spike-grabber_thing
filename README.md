# lego-spike-grabber_thing
grab green/hulk blocks or red/flash blocks and drop in prison

hardware/block design inspired by https://youtu.be/9p44swxSanM?si=ClEU0ij-HsQjQr3M

notable points:
1. This version has a lower placement of color sensor - more reliable given the distance to the blocks/prisoners
2. Code has hardware return to starting point so manual calibration between runs not needed.
